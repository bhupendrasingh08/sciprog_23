**Week 7 Practical**
This is the source code for practical 7 of Scientific Programming. The practical demonstrates how to evaluate the 1st order to 15th order polynomials of 1/x and compares this polynomial to e. The practical further introduces and works with concepts relating to basic C pointers and dynamic memory allocation. To compile the source code use the following commands:

Q1. **Find e**

**To Compile**
	 
    gcc Finde.c -o Finde -lm -Wall

**To print**

    ./Finde

Q.2 **Dynamic allocation**

**To Compile**
	 
    gcc DynamicAllocation.c -o DynamicAllocation -lm -Wall

**To print**

    ./DynamicAllocation

**-lm** is to map math library to the gcc and **-Wall** is to show all the warnings
