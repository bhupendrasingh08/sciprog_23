**Week 5 Practical**

This is the source code for practical 5 of Scientific Programming. There are three different purposes of the code in this directory. The **scanf.c** is simply a file to demonstrate the purposes of the scanf command in C. The **Fibonacci.c** file will compute the fibonacci series up to n. Finally, **Arctan.c** file compares two different methods of computation of the arctanh function. The compilation commands are as follows:

Q1. **User Input**

**To Compile**
	 
    gcc scanf.c -o scanf -lm -Wall

**To print**

    ./scanf

Q.2 **Fibonnaci Series**

**To Compile**
	 
    gcc Fibonnaci.c -o Fibonnaci -lm -Wall

**To print**

    ./Fibonnaci

Q.2 **Artctan Functions**

**To Compile**
	 
    gcc Arctan.c -o Arctan -lm -Wall

**To print**

    ./Arctan

**-lm** is to map math library to the gcc and **-Wall** is to show all the warnings
